    "<p> For this Project, Three themes were considered. They were <b>Theme 1: Sex, Age and Marital Status ,Theme 2: Principal Status ,Theme 3: Education </b> at the level of county. An extensive literature review was done to identify and emphasize on variables that could act as a good predictor for the Unemployment factor present in each county.The most important variables to include in a simple linear regression model were identified and were then used to build the regression model. Based on the predictions done by the model, The best feature was chosen after extensive validation. </p>"

    "<h3> 2 &emsp; INTRODUCTION    </h3>\n",
    "<p> The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is in charge of collecting, collating, analyzing, and sharing statistical data on Ireland's population and economy. The Republic of Ireland's Census 2016 was held on Sunday, April 24, 2016, to administer a national census. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) conducted the census, which revealed a total population of 4,761,865, up 3.8 percent from the previous census in 2011.This was the lowest recorded population growth rate since the 1991 census, with lower birth rates and reduced net migration contributing to the drop in population growth rates.Between April and December 2017, the census results were gradually issued in a series of reports organized as summaries or in-depth results of certain themes such as age, race, or religion.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The census of population is a detailed count of every person living in Ireland on a particular date.The population of the state is determined by the census. It also assists the government in planning how it will provide public services to the state's citizens.Age, marital status, sex, place of birth, occupation, and religion are among the inquiries on the form. The data is then utilized to plan infrastructure for public transportation, healthcare, housing, and education. Census data is used by local governments to forecast demand for their services and facilities. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> The census data is broken down into 15 themes namely Theme 1: Sex, age and marital status,Theme 2: Migration, ethnicity, religion and foreign languages,Theme 3: Irish language,Theme 4: Families,Theme 5: Private households,Theme 6: Housing,Theme 7: Communal establishments,Theme 8: Principal status,Theme 9: Social class and socio-economic group,Theme 10: Education,Theme 11: Commuting,Theme 12: Disability, carers and general health,Theme 13: Occupations,Theme 14: Industries,Theme 15: Motor car availability, PC ownership and internet access. These themes are further classified into many tables which explain the characteristics of the county based on the data. The themes that are chosen for this project are <b>Theme 1: Sex, Age and Marital Status ,Theme 2: Principal Status ,Theme 3: Education </b>.These themes consisted tables with information regarding age and gender-wise distribution, principal status and education status of each individual in county.</p>\n",
    "        \n",
    "<p> For theme 1, there were 105 columns describing how total number of people in a county is distributed across all age groups and gender. This was very intuitive as it helped to understand the composition of male and female in a county. This provided us information like what proportion of people belonged to a certain age group. Using this, in the project , there was some analysis done the male female composition, categorisation of people based on age like children, youth,teenager,young adults,middle age, old age. Using this, the proportion of people who are at the right age to be employed was determined which was opted as a feature indicator to predict the unemployment in each county.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> For theme 2, There were 27 columns which described the status of the people like whether are unemployed, or whether they are looking for their first job, where they are students, whether they are disabled, whether they are looking after their family and so on. These were again categorised into male and female to make it the gender distribution among statuses clear. But for this project, the main concern was to predict the unemployment count per county. For this, only two data was considered from the theme, they were <i>'Looking for first job'</i> and <i>'Unemployed having lost or given up previous job' </i> . The rest deemed unnecessary as they clearly didn't portray the meaning of unemployment.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> For theme 3, there were three tables describing the Education status of the individuals. They described whether the individual has completed his/her education, whether it is in progress and the field of study of the individual. This was described using 110 feature vectors. But for this project, Total no of individuals who have completed studying or still studying was demmed sufficient to act as predictor variables for unemployment count per county. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> This project will begin by doing an Explorative Data Analysis on the given dataset and try to find and filter the neccessary feature and group them into meaningful tables. Then there will analysis on the distribution of these selected variable.<b>This report will aim to find the best possible predictor variable which can be used to predict the unemployment count in the county.</b> The main aim is to try build a linear relationship between the total unemployement and any of the feature like education or age . This is verified using various methodologies in this report. The finding and conclusions are presented below in the report. </p>"

    "<h3>4  &emsp; CONCLUSIONS</h3>\n",
    "<p> In this project we were trying to determine the best possible predictor variable to predict the unemployement per county. We initially considered four set of variables <i> Education_Completed, Education_In_Progress, Male_Female_Ratio and Total_People_In_Working_Age </i>. By just having a glance at the variable, we feel that this might account for linear relationship with the total unemployment count. But When we try top infer this using various methods, we come to know the true picture. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> For Linear Regression model , we assume that the predictor variables are normally distributed and independent. If these assumption hold true, then only we can get a meaningfull model. So to verify this, we checked if all the features are normally distributed. But they were not, So we used logarithmic method to make them normally distributed. Them using these New data we tried to find which is the best feature.</p>\n",
    "<p> In this report, I have mainly used two validation methods to determine the feature importance. One is <i>Correlation score </i> and other is <i>P-value score</i>. First I filtered out the features having very high correlation using a user defined function remove_collinear_features for which we defined the threshold as 0.6. All the features which had higher correlation score was removed. High correlation means they are dependent, Hence it violates the Regression Analysis assumption. So we removed <i>Education_InProgress_Total and People_In_Working_Age </i>.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now with the remaining two features, I build the linear regression model and tried to verify the P-score. The P-Value provides probability of the hypothesis test, So in a regression model the P-Value for each independent variable tests the Null Hypothesis that there is “No Correlation” between the independent and the dependent variable,this also helps to determine the relationship observed in the sample also exists in the larger data.So if the P-Value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05) then your model fits the data well. In our case, p-value is less than 0.05 only for <i>Education_Completed</i> which means that the model fits for this feature better than the rest of them. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> So we can conclude that, The best predictor for Total Unemployment in each county is Education_Completed based on all the factors and we were able to find a linear relationship with the variable.</p> \n",
    "<p>However we can see that, the model accuracy is not perfect. There is some error. This section needs further investigation to determine if the linear regression is the best model fot this dataset. There can be complex models which can provide better results for this dataset. This can be part of the furher research which can be done on the Census Data."
